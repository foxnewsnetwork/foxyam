Fireworks
=
They're rather strange things. Even the word, a combination of fire and work, seem to remind me that I should be working right now if I wanted to keep my job, instead of loitering around a high school wanting to watch the fireworks show. Here I was, 25 years old, on the first ring of the first ladder in the slow climb in my career; there was still code to be written, ideas to be learned, people to be talked to, workflows to be planned, etc. 

I need to be back on the computer getting the ball rolling. Instead of standing out in the chilly Camarillo night amidst happy youngsters, horny teenagers, and retired adults wanting blankly with my nipples sticking against my too-thin shirt.

What am I doing here? What am I doing?

In the background, the Major's speech, delivered over the PA system setup for the usual football games, drew to a close "and with that, here's music from the 60s to celebrate the 50th year of our city..."

And, just as Jimi Hendrix's guitar came on, a shrill whistle split the air as a streak of twirling light shot upward to the sky. A blast of vibrant colors exploded in the sky above, and a resounding bang rocked into me moments later. Another - a red streak - followed, then a burst of other colors, then another, and yet another.

With each resounding bang, conversation seemed to fade from years, worries and concerns from my thoughts. Each loud explosion echoed my heartbeat and seemed to shake off all the years that have piled atop it. A whiff of sulfurous scent, laden with memory, caught me and I found myself walking closer, across football bleachers, high school parking lots and oceans and years.

The cascading shimmering lights, raining from the sky, washed away logic and complication, leaving only emotion and memory.

I was back in Chengdu, China. On grandma's countryside boonie home. The sultry humid Chengdu air. The humble incandescent lightbulbs hanging from makeshift racks aside crude cement walls. The milling shadows of aunts, uncles, cousins, parents, and grandparents chatting over a simple but plentiful dinner. The chickens in the background. My sisters. Me. Hide-and-seek. Apricots. And the fireworks.

The simple, wonderful, timeless joy of fireworks.

The colorful dancing bridge of memory that span across time and space, brings back the dead, reunits families, reverses urbanization, and takes me back to a home faraway.

In that 30 minute fireworks show was the magic of the ages, and it left me a complete emotional wreck afterwards. I found myself lost in thought as I walked back to the car with mommy. I found myself wondering if she too was wandering back from her own sojourn across time and space.

Well anyway, I'm glad I went.
