Why We Still Use Pencils 
========================

Today, I was given an extremely simple task by my employer: bring out the bird's eye view on google maps. She wanted to look at a peice of real estate to consider purchasing. Easy, I thought, there's a convenient button on the top right corner of the googlemaps site where you just click on it, a context menu drops down, then you click the option for satellite view.

But then, I loaded up Googlemaps on the browser and realized to my chagrin the UI changed again. The button on the top right that used to manage the context menu for map view modes has now been replaced with a context menu for controlling what account I'm logging into (a la gmail). And, after a good several minutes of clicking about the page looking for where these Googlers might've relocated the satellite view button, I finally discovered it hidden within the street-view bottom navigation inline with a bunch of carousel photos of the street view.

To a normal person, such an "update" to the UI might simply cause a bit of minor annoyance before he or she figures it out, but to me, this was a flagrant slap on the face of design principles and usability. Some google engineer / designer / product manager somewhere probably got the brilliant idea that "hey, we can optimize X if we change the UI here, that way we unify the functionality of all our products", then, throwing aside all concepts of familiarity, usability, and convenience out the window for some horseshit fascination with symmetry in functionality, Google signed off on this change after a bit of A-B testing.

"Hey, check it out, we're creating new and cool things here at Google" says the product manager upon seeing this new feature, "We're working hard!"

But let's consider the results of his hard work:

1. Paid hours of him and his programmers to build these new UI changes
2. Paid hours of me (and other users like me) figuring out their new UI changes

On top of that, why does it matter what account I'm on gmaps with? Are the streets and buildings going to be different for me if I'm logged in as profession-email@gmail.com versus lolkiddyporn420@gmail.com?

Google, plesae note that new is not always better; in fact, it's often worse because it comes at the cost of extra having to learn your new stupid peice of shit. This is precisely why junk like the dvorak keyboard hasn't caught on and why we still type on qwerty keyboards despite the "lower speed"; why we still sketch with pencils despite having USB canvas pads; why we still do math on paper when we have calculators.

Familiarity is king, and, as designers, you should only break from it if what you're offering in return is an order of magnitude better than what we have with familiarity. Innovation is like the fat on a juicy steak; keep it in small amount along the edges to have a delicious meal, but if your steak is pure fat, it's just not edible.

Google, for every reason you could have for deciding why it was a good idea to integrate accounts into gmaps and making satellite view confusing as hell, I can give you a counter reason:

R: G+ needs to be integrated for company vision and internal politics
A: Users don't give two shits about your internal politics and they'll share your vision for only as long as you're looking in the same direction as they are.

R: Users don't know what they want; they need to be taught
A: Users may not know how to get what they want, but they definitely know what they want - money, fame, attention, and convenience. 

R: The current UI is more efficient
A: Users don't give two shits about your metric for efficiency; they want efficiency because they want to use your maps now, not after they learn how to be more efficient according to you.

R: But our A-B tests...
A: Fuck your A/B tests. A/B tests are social experiments run by engineers with no theory or model behind human behavior and so result in just as much noise being treated as data as anything useful. Simplify and instead just observe how people are using your product.

R: In the long run, these new UI changes will make/save the company money
A: UI changes never make money for anyone. Marketing and users finding your product useful makes money. If you make your product less useful in the short run in hopes of making it more useful in the long run, you'll damage your user-base and there might never be a long run.

TL;DR: if you're designing UI, get it right the first time and never overhaul its appearance even if you got it wrong the first time.
